Install zstd on Mac using homebrew

    Mac: using homebrew "brew install zstd"
    Linux: use the relevant package manager (e.g. "sudo apt install libzstd-dev").
           The -dev variant includes the necessary headers.

* run ./compile.sh or ./compilesource.sh to jextract zstd headers

* run

    sh ./run.sh

NOTE: For Linux, the path $(brew --prefix zstd) needs to be replaced with
      relevant code (e.g. $(pkg-config --variable=prefix libzstd) )

NOTE: This example is compatible with zstd 1.5.2 - 1.5.4. Make sure your zstd version is compatible
      with any of these version in order to run the example.
